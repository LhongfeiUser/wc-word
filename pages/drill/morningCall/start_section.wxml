For questions with geometric figures,you should base your answers on geometric reasoning,not on estimating or comparing quantities by sight or by measurement. \n Coordinate systems,such as xy-planes and number lines,<text class='subheadBold'>are</text> drawn to scale;therefore you can read, estimate, or compare quantities in such figures by sight or by measurement. \n Graphical data presentations,such as bar graphs,circle graphs,and line graphs,<text class='subheadBold'>are</text> drawn to scale;therefore you can read, estimate, or compare data values by sight or by measurement. \n Click <text class='subheadBold'>Continue</text> to go on.</text>
